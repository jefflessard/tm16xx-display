Description:
		Controls the text displayed on the TM16xx 7-segment display.

		Reading returns the current display content as ASCII characters,
		one character per digit position, followed by a newline.

		Writing sets new display content. Input characters are mapped
		to 7-segment patterns using the configured character map. The
		string length should not exceed the number of available digits
		(see num_digits). Shorter strings will clear remaining digits.

		Example:
		  echo "1234" > value    # Display "1234"
		  cat value              # Returns "1234\n"

Description:
		Read-only attribute showing the number of 7-segment digit
		positions available on this TM16xx display controller.

		The value is determined by the device tree configuration
		and represents the maximum length for the 'value' attribute.

		Example:
		  cat num_digits         # Returns "4\n" for 4-digit display

KernelVersion:	6.17
Contact:	Jean-François Lessard <jefflessard3@gmail.com>
Description:
		Read/write binary blob representing the ASCII-to-7-segment
		display conversion table used by the TM16xx driver, as defined
		by struct seg7_conversion_map in <linux/map_to_7segment.h>.

		This attribute is not human-readable. Writes must match the
		struct size exactly, else -EINVAL is returned; reads return the
		entire mapping as a binary blob.

		This interface and its implementation match existing conventions
		used in auxdisplay and segment-mapped display drivers since 2005.

		ABI note: This style of binary sysfs attribute *is an exception*
		to current "one value per file, text only" sysfs rules, for
		historical compatibility and driver uniformity. New drivers are
		discouraged from introducing additional binary sysfs ABIs.

		Reference interface guidance:
		- include/uapi/linux/map_to_7segment.h
Users:		Display configuration utilities and embedded system scripts/tools.
